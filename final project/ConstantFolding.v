(** before partial evalation, the first part I want to implement
  a more simple idea, constant folding

  An expression is constant when it contains no variable
  references. Constant folding is an optimization that finds constant
  expressions and replaces them by their values. 
  
  Some definition and proof idea is followed equiv.v in the software
  foundation book
